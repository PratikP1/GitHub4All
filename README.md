# GitHub4All
A public space for accessibility issues with GitHub, not managed by GitHub. 

GitHub is great! It has become a part of the infrastructure of progress. Yet many people with disabilites are not able to be part of this amazing community. This isn't because of a technical limitation, but because accessibility hasn't been made a large enough priority within the GitHub team. 

Help GitHub get their priorities right by signing on as an individual (or organization) onto this list.
