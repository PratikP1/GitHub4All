# GitHub4All
A public space for accessibility issues with GitHub, not managed by GitHub. 

GitHub is great! It has become a part of the infrastructure of progress. Yet many people with disabilities are not able to be part of this amazing community. This isn't because of a technical limitation, but because accessibility hasn't been made a large enough priority within the GitHub team. 

Add accessibility issues to the issue associated with this project and then email support@github.com.

GitHub needs an issue queue of it's own to manage accessibility problems as they inevitably come up. Having an responsive person at the end of a support email is great, but as every GitHub project owner knows, there's a lot more power to a threaded issue queue than there is to email support. A GitHub issue queue allows:

1) Everyone to see the issues that have been posted to check to see if someone has already reported it. 

2) Provides a transparent space to see how long it takes issues to be addressed, thus giving users confidence that accessibility issues have priority. 

3) Interested parties can't review "bugs" and offer suggestions. We'd like GitHub to have a team of accessibility experts to resolve these issues, but even better, we want GitHub to leverage a community of users who already have expertise in this area and use GitHub. 

Help GitHub get their priorities right by signing on as an individual (or organization) onto this list.
